# Your Personal Portfolio

Welcome to your new portfolio website! This site is built with modern, high-performance technologies but requires **no software installation** to run.

## 🚀 How to Run
Simply double-click `index.html` to open your website in any browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, etc.).

## 📝 How to Edit Content
All the content on your website is controlled by a single file: `data.js`.
1. Open `data.js` in any text editor (Notepad, VS Code, etc.).
2. You will see sections like `general`, `projects`, etc.
3. Change the text inside the quotes to update your site.
4. Save the file and refresh your browser to see changes.

## 📂 Handling Images and Files
1. Go to the `assets` folder.
2. Paste your images (profile photo, project screenshots) and files (resumes PDF, project reports) here.
3. In `data.js`, update the paths to match your filenames.
   - Example: `url: "assets/my-new-resume.pdf"`

## ✨ Features
- **Project Filtering**: Add new "classifications" in `data.js`, and new filter buttons will appear automatically.
- **Dark Mode / Premium Design**: Built-in glassmorphism effects.
- **Direct File Viewing**: Links to PDFs in the assets folder will open directly in the browser.

Enjoy building your brand!
